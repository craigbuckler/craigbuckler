# Hello! I'm Craig Buckler 👋

You may have seen some of my stuff at [SitePoint.com](https://www.sitepoint.com/author/craig-buckler) and a few othe places.


## Current projects 🚧

🐳 [Docker for Web Developers book and video course](https://dockerwebdev.com/) which is for anyone who thinks Docker is complex and isn't for them.

🦕 [A first look at Deno](https://conference.techexeter.uk/speakers/craig-buckler.html) to be shown at the [TechExeter conference on 9 and 10 September 2020](https://conference.techexeter.uk/).

📷 [progressive-image.js](https://github.com/craigbuckler/progressive-image.js) receives updates now and again.

🐧 Writing a complete guide to the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2) for SitePoint.com.

💡 Also trying to learn too many things at once, but [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) is high up on the list.


## Contact me 📫

I'm available for hire, ideally remote full-stack web development with Node.js, Deno, databases, WebSockets, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc. I'll do PHP if you absolutely insist.

You can find my contact details over there... 👈
