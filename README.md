# 👋 Hello!

**I'm Craig Buckler.**

You may have seen some of my stuff at [SitePoint.com](https://www.sitepoint.com/author/craig-buckler) and a few other places.

## 🚧 Current projects

🐳 [Docker for Web Developers book and video course](https://dockerwebdev.com/) which is for anyone who thinks Docker is complex and isn't for them.

🦕 [A first look at Deno](https://conference.techexeter.uk/speakers/craig-buckler.html) to be shown at the [TechExeter conference on 9 and 10 September 2020](https://conference.techexeter.uk/).

📷 [progressive-image.js](https://github.com/craigbuckler/progressive-image.js) receives updates now and again.

✍️ I'm writing a complete guide to [Deno ES modules](https://www.sitepoint.com/deno-module-system-a-beginners-guide/) and the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2) for [SitePoint.com](https://www.sitepoint.com/author/craig-buckler).

💡 Also trying to learn too many things at once, but [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) is high up on the list.

🕹️ If you'd like a quick blast, play my [multi-device Asteriods game](https://craigbuckler.com/asteroids/) and [view it's repo](https://github.com/craigbuckler/asteroids).
