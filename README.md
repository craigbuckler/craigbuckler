🐳 My [**Docker for Web Developers** book and video course](https://dockerwebdev.com/) is for anyone who thinks Docker is too complex and isn't for them.

🦕 [**A first look at Deno** presentation](https://conference.techexeter.uk/speakers/craig-buckler.html) to be shown at the [TechExeter conference on 9 and 10 September 2020](https://conference.techexeter.uk/).

📷 [**progressive-image.js**](https://github.com/craigbuckler/progressive-image.js) receives updates now and again.

✍️ I'm writing a complete guide to [**Deno ES modules**](https://www.sitepoint.com/deno-module-system-a-beginners-guide/) and the **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2)** for [SitePoint.com](https://www.sitepoint.com/author/craig-buckler). You can also get a copy of my [**Jump Start Web Performance** book](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B084SPDY3C/craigbucklerc-21) which has dozens of easy, not so easy, and life-changing tips.

💡 Also trying to learn too many things at once, but [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) is high up on the list.

🕹️ If you'd like a quick blast, play my [multi-device **Asteroids** game](https://craigbuckler.com/asteroids/) and [view it's repo](https://github.com/craigbuckler/asteroids).
